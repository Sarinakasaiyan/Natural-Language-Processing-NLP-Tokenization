Text Tokenization with NLTK in Natural Language Processing

This project demonstrates how to use the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) module for text tokenization. Tokenization is a fundamental step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that divides text into smaller, processable units.

nstallation and Setup
First, we need to install NLTK and download the required data:

input:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

output:

[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...
[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!
True

Main Code

input:

from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize,word_tokenize
s =  "A SINGLE DAY CAN CHANGE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE ! [SARINAKASAIYAN]"
w = word_tokenize(s)
print(w)

output:

['A', 'SINGLE', 'DAY', 'CAN', 'CHANGE', 'YOUR', 'ENTIRE', 'LIFE', '!', '[', 'SARINAKASAIYAN', ']']

Code Explanation
We use word_tokenize to split the text into words.
The sentence is stored in the variable s.
We tokenize the text using word_tokenize(s).
The result is printed.


Output Analysis

Each word is identified as a separate token.
The punctuation mark (!) is also considered as a distinct token.
Brackets and their content are recognized as separate tokens.

Applications

Tokenization is used in many NLP applications, including:
Sentiment Analysis
Text Classification
Keyword Extraction
Language Model Building

Conclusion

Tokenization with NLTK is a simple and effective method for breaking down text into processable components. 
This technique provides a foundation for many more complex tasks in natural language processing.
